    				<h3>What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible? (Remember, you can use the Section tag with jQuery, for instance)</h3>
    				<p>I could support some of the tags using HTML like the ‘alt’ tag when using images to describe what the image is displaying. I could also probably organize my sections better so that the screen readers could easily find the sections of my content. For example, the headers and menu items below them.</p>
 
				<h3>Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?</h3>
				<p>The most common is that each website tries to have some great style that makes it hard for a screen reader to just pick up and see what’s going on. Or if they use graphics for menus, then it’s impossible for screen readers to pick out the content needed to explain to the user.</p>
				 
				<h3>Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</h3>
				<p>One of the most common devices I see that are made for accessibly are ATM machines. Each one I’ve ever come across has braille so blind users can easily still get access to the machine. The other are smart phones, with not only screen readers, but also magnifying glass which will zoom in a certain part of the screen and high contract for users who have problems seeing colors.</p>
				
				<h3>Please describe any design and functionality intentions you may have for your Demo app components this month.</h3>
				<p>I plan to add native file system functionality to my design. I also intend to get my app running on the iPad and the Android emulator and incorporate a weather data service in addition to the Instagram one required by the assignment.</p>
				
				<h3>Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</h3>
				<p>Most stock applications that come with the stock iOS and Android operating systems have accessibility features built right into the system. Apple specifically has done wondering with blind users, who have praised the operating system for being easy to use with users who need accessibility features.</p>
