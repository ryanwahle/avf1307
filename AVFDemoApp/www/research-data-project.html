    				<h3>Less obvious perks of using 'live' data resources include logins and payments. How could Twitter be used in these two scenarios?</h3>
    				<p>Having one login to multiple websites and payment systems are a real benefit for users. No longer do they have to remember multiple passwords, they can just use their Twitter account to login to everything. This also includes payments, where instead of having an actual PayPal account, PayPal would link to the users Twitter account. It’s really great for the user.</p>
 
				<h3>Visit Programmableweb.com and search for JSON-P data sources. Why would we need JSON-P, specifically?</h3>
				<p>After going to programmableweb.com, I could only find a data source listed for JSON, not JSON-P. The search results are so large, that it’s clear that JSON is a create format to transfer data between different applications, really only for the popularity. And it’s only popular because it fits the needs of the developers.</p>
				<p>I searched the web for what the difference is, and we need JSON-P because with JSON requests, you can not request data from a website that is not on the same server as your own application. Since we are trying to retrieve data from sources that other company provide, we need JSON-P.</p>
 
				<h3>Based on the JSON-P search results: what data resource(s) do you think might pair well with which types of Native device features?</h3>
				<p>Adcentricity ADMobile - Location based mobile shopping service; could be used with the GPS on the native device.</p>
				<p>Exosite - Cloud storage platform; could be used to sync data from the native devices file system.</p>
				<p>FlashFoto Image Processing - Image processing service; could grab photos from native camera to manipulate native images.</p>
 
				<h3>Please describe any design and functionality intentions you may have for your Demo app components this month.</h3>
				<p>I plan to add native file system functionality to my design. I also intend to get my app running on the iPad and the Android emulator and incorporate a weather data service in addition to the Instagram one required by the assignment.</p>
				
				<h3>Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.</h3>
				<p>Plan ahead and pay attention to detail while you do so. Forgetting the simplest item, or assuming something might not be needed without investigating will bite you later down the road.</p>
