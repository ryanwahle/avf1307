    			<p>The top selling app in the U.S. is Games, Education in Japan, and Entertainment in Great Britain (Statista).</p>
    			<p>The categories tell a lot of how a country is. What's popular in a country at the time will also change and so will the top app categories. You need to be aware.</p>    			
    			<p>The average cost of bandwidth in the U.S. is $20, $24.20 in Japan, and $20 in the U.K. (Pingdom). If you developed your app for the U.S. then later on you decided to sell it in Japan. Well, in Japan it is more expensive for internet, so you may want to optimize your network code, and minimize your data usage. It really helps your customers in the end.</p>
    			<p>The best product strategy here is to focus on the categories. Everything else comes later. So get out in the real world and do research in your areas. Find out whats up and coming, and most likely the top category will follow.</p>
